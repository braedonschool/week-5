                    <p>Back in the early months of World War II, one of the Germans first targets was France, due to Frances stalwart battle against Germany in the first World War, they wanted revenge.</p>

                    <p>The French, since WWI had ended had established the Maginot line, a heavy line of defenses at the north eastern border of France, as pictured above. The had left the border of Belgium and Luxembourg fairly under-protected, due to dense terrain there, though to be impassable.</p>

                    <p>In 1940, the French had set up their defensive position at the Maginot line, preparing for an invasion directly from Germany. They however, were not ready for an invasion through Belgium, which is what happened.</p>

                <p>The Germans stormed through Belgium with ease, corning troops at Dunkirk and then continuing through to France, able to easily pass through the weakened defense at the Maginot line, storming towards Paris with relative ease.</p>

                    <p>With the germans now having Paris, the French are forced to sue for peace, allowing the Germans to occupy their land and requisition their supplies for the next 4 years, until the landings at Normany which would free the French people.</p>

                    <p>Not all of France was held in German captivity, however, almost half of the nation still fought on in the south east of the territory, and would continue to do so until the end of Frances occupiment. Even in the occupied zone, French nationalists would fight on, rebelling against the opressive rule of the Germans.</p>

            <h3>In summary, France kind of got folded during WWII, but their stalwart refusal to give into the Germans, even when they took over the France government, was truly inspiring.</h3>
